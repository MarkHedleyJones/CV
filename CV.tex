\mySect{PHILOSOPHY}{}
\begin{centering}
\onehalfspacing
\noindent
Something isn't right just because other people are doing it - sometimes they're all wrong\\
\noindent
The ability to teach yourself is more valuable than your degrees\\
\noindent
Test ideas early and invest time in reducing the cost to re-test\\
\noindent
Truly novel solutions require creativity, not experience\\
